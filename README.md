# Rocket_Elevators_Customer_Portal
## Week-11, Understanding the .NET Framework

During Week 11, as Rocket Elevators now has a website which, in addition to showcasing its products, serves as a management platform for its employees. We would now like to offer our customers the ability to view and track their solutions in addition to being able to make service requests on their in-service products. This platform will be distinct from the main Rocket Elevators website and will therefore have its own domain and user experience. The customer portal will have to make use of the Rocket Elevators API developed in the previous weeks and it will potentially have to be improved.

The elements incorporated into the new portal are:
- Authentication page
- Home page
- Different pages allowing customers to view and manage their products
- Intervention request form

### The new portal is available here : [Customer's Portal](https://rocketelevatorscustomersportal.azurewebsites.net/Identity/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2F)
**Here are the login information to test the Customer's Portal:**
- user: agnes_spencer@fay.com
- password: Rocket12345!

### The new REST API is available here: [REST API](https://github.com/CptnWookie/Rocket_Elevators_REST_API)
